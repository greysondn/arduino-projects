This code enables me to add some intelligence to my home window ACU.

Initially I had no plans to really do much here, but... It works as a good
first project, I think.

My ACU is evidently a GE AGQ06LHG1. It's a little dated. It has an IR remote controller and isn't in the best shape of anything ever.

The fact that it uses an IR controller allows me to controller it from some sort of intelligent assembly.
